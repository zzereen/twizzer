Written in Python, this project aims to make command-line interfaces pretty again with tweets from Twitter.

This is my very first project using Python. This project is to put my new programming skills into use.

##Libraries used:
TwitterAPI: https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI

Tweepy: https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy
